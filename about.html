              <p>
                I would like to extend a warm welcome to you. I am a Registered Nurse and Delegating Nurse with extensive experience supporting individuals served by Maryland’s Developmental Disabilities Administration (DDA). I founded Rise Nurse Collective to bring a higher standard of delegation, clinical oversight, and compassionate nursing practice to the agencies and individuals I work with. My belief is very simple: I want to elevate nurse delegation and ensure that every person receives safe, consistent, and respectful care.
              </p>
              <p>
                Throughout my DDA nursing career, I have worked across residential programs, personal supports, and day services, gaining a deep understanding of the unique health needs and risks within the IDD community. I specialize in developing individualized Nursing Care Plans, training and supervising Certified Medication Technicians (CMTs), improving medication systems, and strengthening agency compliance with COMAR and DDA expectations. I am passionate about helping staff feel confident and competent, and I take pride in breaking down complex clinical concepts into practical, understandable guidance. I love to teach and always tell staff that it is my job to make their job easier.
              </p>
              <p>
                One of my priorities with this company is maintaining small caseloads so we can give every individual and agency the time, attention, and quality they deserve. We take a hands-on, collaborative approach and make communication a cornerstone of our practice. My goal is always to support my team, reduce preventable health incidents, and create safer, more informed environments for the people we serve.
              </p>
              <p>
                I am currently pursuing my Master of Science in Nursing (MSN) and will graduate in February 2026. Some of my academic work has focused on reducing aspiration pneumonia in individuals with intellectual and developmental disabilities through improved screening and targeted staff training, along with other “fatal five” subjects. This work reflects my commitment to evidence-based practice and continuous improvement in community-based nursing. My practicum will involve developing a nursing training program for new nurses in DDA and focusing on work/life balance, as I believe these are imperative in forming a solid, confident, and fulfilled nurse. I am an active member of DDNA and have earned my CDDN certification, which reflects my dedication to advancing the quality of care for individuals with developmental disabilities.
              </p>
              <p>
                Rise Nurse Collective is an extension of what I believe in most: empowering staff, advocating for individuals, and elevating the standard of nurse delegation across Maryland. Thank you for your interest in my company and my amazing team. I am hopeful to be connected with you soon.

              <p>I’ve spent more than 15 years working in safety, compliance, and emergency services as an EMT and firefighter, and I’ve always had a heart for helping people feel safe, supported, and cared for.
              </p>
                <p>
                Today, I serve as the Compliance Officer, HR lead, and Accounts Payable/Receivable Manager for Rise Nurse Collective, where I make sure our team has what they need to provide the best possible care. I love being part of an organization that truly values compassion, dignity, and person-centered support.
              </p>
                <p>
                I also own a sensory product company that grew out of my passion for creating calming, meaningful tools for individuals with sensory and developmental needs. This work is especially close to my heart because I’m a mom of two wonderful children. My son is working in the hospitality industry, and my daughter (who was formally diagnosed with Autism and SPD at 18 months old) is starting her high school years as a home schooled lover of learning. Being a special-needs parent has taught me patience, empathy, and the importance of meeting people exactly where they are.
              </p>
                <p>
                I’ve been married to my husband for 19 years, and we’re raising our family together in a home filled with love, resilience, and a whole lot of laughter.
              </p>
                <p>
                No matter what role I’m in — safety, compliance, business owner, or mom — my goal is always the same: to make life a little easier, a little safer, and a lot more compassionate for the people I serve.</p>
