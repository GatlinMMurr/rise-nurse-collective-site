        <h2>Who We Are</h2>
        <p>
          Rise Nurse Collective LLC is a nurse-led partner for agencies and teams serving people with
          intellectual and developmental disabilities in Maryland. We focus on practical, relationship-based
          nursing support—so complex regulations translate into clear, doable steps for staff and families.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our work sits at the intersection of people’s real lives and regulatory requirements. We aim to
          make nursing support feel less intimidating and more like a natural part of the person’s daily routine.
