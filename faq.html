          <p>
            Maryland requires a Registered Nurse to assess, train, and oversee staff performing nursing tasks such as medication administration, diabetes care, seizure protocols, bowel programs, and more. The RN CM/DN is clinically responsible for all delegated tasks and must complete ongoing oversight, training, and reassessments following COMAR regulations. A goal of Rise Nurse Collective is to  ensure every delegated task is performed safely, correctly, and consistently.

            Yes. We provide staff trainings focused on medication, observation, and safety. A booking system

            Visit frequency depends on the people you support, the tasks being delegated, and regulatory
            requirements. We’ll collaborate with you to set a schedule that meets DDA and nursing board
            expectations while fitting your agency’s routines.
